# CVE-2022-23046 - PHPIPAM

TL;DR

This write up is about a SQL injection which I found 4 days after another researcher reported it :/, however, because of the fact that I haven’t found any write ups or publicly available exploits, I decided to write about it.
Exploit at the end!

PHPIPAM is a software widely used internally by several companies. And by being so, it is relatively common for you to find a running instance to manage IT assets, networks, etc. **1.4.4** is the vulnerable version and a fix has already been made public with the arrival of version **1.4.5**. The request responsible for triggering the SQLi is presented below, but if you want to look at the rest, feel free.

```

## Code Investigation

By analyzing the following code, we can see that validation is only enforced against the **bgp_id** parameter

```php
<?php

/* functions */
require_once( dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../../functions/functions.php' );

# initialize user object
$Database 	= new Database_PDO;
$User 		= new User ($Database);
$Admin	 	= new Admin ($Database);
$Tools	 	= new Tools ($Database);
$Result 	= new Result ();

# verify that user is logged in
$User->check_user_session();

# permissions
$User->check_module_permissions ("routing", User::ACCESS_RW, true, false);

# validates
if(!is_numeric($_POST['bgp_id']))  			{ $Result->show("danger",  _("Invalid ID"), true); }
if(strlen($_POST['subnet'])<2)				{ $Result->show("danger",  _("Please enter at least 2 characters."), true); }

# query
$query = 'select INET_NTOA(`subnet`) as subnet,id,mask,description from `subnets` where INET_NTOA(`subnet`) like "'.$_POST['subnet'].'%" and `subnet` > 1 and `isFolder` = 0';
# execute
try { $subnets = $Database->getObjectsQuery($query); }
catch (Exception $e) {
	print $Result->show("danger", $e->getMessage(), true);
}

# printout
if(sizeof($subnets)>0) {
	// remove existing
	$bgp_mapped_subnets = $Tools->fetch_routing_subnets ("bgp", $_POST['bgp_id'], false);
	$map_arr = [];
	if($bgp_mapped_subnets!==false) {
		foreach ($bgp_mapped_subnets as $m) {
			$map_arr[] = $m->subnet_id;
		}
	}

	// print remaining
	$cnt=0;
	print "<table class='table table-condensed table-auto'>";
	foreach ($subnets as $s) {
		if (!in_array($s->id, $map_arr)) {
			print "<tr>";
			print "<td><btn class='btn btn-xs btn-success add_bgp_mapping' data-subnetId='$s->id' data-bgp_id='$_POST[bgp_id]' data-curr_id='$cnt'><i class='fa fa-plus'></i></btn></td>";
			print "<td>";
			print "<select name='select-$cnt' class='select-$cnt form-control input-w-auto input-sm'>";
			print "	<option value='advertised'>"._("Advertised")."</option>";
			print "	<option value='received'>"._("Received")."</option>";
			print "</select>";
			print "</td>";
			print "<td> $s->subnet/$s->mask ($s->description)</td>";
			print "<td class='result-$cnt'></td>";
			print "</tr>";
			$cnt++;
		}
	}
	print "</table>";
	// none
	if($cnt==0) {
		print $Result->show("info", "No subnets found", true);
	}
}
else {
	print $Result->show("info", "No subnets found", true);
}
```

Because of the **is_numeric** function, maybe by using versions prior to PHP 5.x, a bypass would occur using 0x[numbers] because, in older PHP versions this was possible, (if you find any way of performing this currently, then you’ve found another vuln). Then we could jump to the next parameter of the request, in this case the **$_POST[‘subnet’]** parameter. In it there is a validation, albeit a simple one, the double quotes ("), is still part of the validation, and if you observe carefully, the next step regards precisely concatenating these parameters in a SQL query.  In other words, this simple ", can cause problems :D or not. It all depends on your perspective. So by looking at the following query, can you already understand how the execution would flow?

```php
$query = 'select INET_NTOA(`subnet`) as subnet,id,mask,description from `subnets` where INET_NTOA(`subnet`) like "'.$_POST['subnet'].'%" and `subnet` > 1 and `isFolder` = 0';
```

It could be something like this:

```sql
select INET_NTOA(subnet) as subnet,id,mask,description from subnets where INET_NTOA(subnet) like "[YOUR DOUBLE QUOTES HERE]" and subnet > 1 and isFolder = 0
```

The Syntax error will be triggered. As illustrated in the following, at the **subnet** vulnerable parameter.

From there we can see that this is a classic based error, so let’s go union :D. First let’s determine how many columns are being returned from the original query (using the **Order by** clause):

![Untitled](/static/images/Untitled%201.png)

The column in an **ORDER BY** clause can be specified by its index (e.g: 1,2,3,4,5,n), this means there’s no  need of knowing the names of any columns. When the specified column index exceeds the number of actual columns in the result set, the database returns an error, such as:


![Untitled](/static/images/Untitled%202.png)

The application might actually return the database error in its HTTP response, or it might return a generic error, or simply return no results. Provided you can detect some difference in the application's response, you can infer how many columns are being returned from the query. The reason for performing an SQL injection UNION attack is to be able to retrieve the results from an injected query. Generally, the interesting data that you want to retrieve will be in string form, so you need to find one or more columns in the original query results whose data type is, or is compatible with, string data Having already determined the number of required columns, you can probe
each column to test whether it can hold string data by submitting a series of `UNION SELECT` payloads that place a string value into each column in turn:

![Untitled](/static/images/Untitled%203.png)

If an error does not occur, and the application’s response contains some additional content including the injected string value, then the relevant column is suitable for retrieving string data

Seek in the following request/response the values of the commands, @@version, database() and user():

Now let's dump users and passwords.

When you have determined the number of columns returned by the original query and found which columns can hold string data, you are in position to retrieve interesting data.
